## Translators needed!

Currently Admingenerator is translated into Translated into 13 languages (DE, 
**EN (default)**, ES, FA, FR, IT, JA, PL, PT, RU, SL, TR, UK). However, some of 
these translations were done long time ago, and new messages were translated 
useing Google Translator. If you have time to do it, *please review translations
for your language*.

## New features / bugfixes

Currently we're trying to ship a stable release for Symfony2.3 LTS. Bugfixes are 
very welcome. Older branches are considered unstable and will not be supported, 
they are left only for legacy users whom we encourage to update to current master.
