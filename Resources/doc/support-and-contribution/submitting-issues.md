# Submitting issues
---------------------------------------

Before you submit an issue [make sure][docs-features] the feature you're haveing 
trouble with is supported for your model manager.

[docs-features]: https://github.com/symfony2admingenerator/AdmingeneratorGeneratorBundle/blob/master/Resources/doc/documentation.md#3-features

### Step 1: check existing issues

Go to [our issues page][docs-issues] and search existing issues, your problem may have been answered there already.

[docs-issues]: https://github.com/symfony2admingenerator/AdmingeneratorGeneratorBundle/issues

### Step 2: check google groups

Go to [our google group][docs-google] and search existing threads, your problem may have been answered there already.

[docs-google]: http://groups.google.com/group/symfony2admingenerator/topics

### Step 3: create new issue

Though we support both [Github issues][docs-issues] and [Google Group][docs-google], we prefer you use **Github** becouse issues written useing [Github Flavored Markdown][docs-markdown] are much more human-readable.

To create a new issue go to [Github issues][docs-issues] and click on **New issue** button (or use [this shortcut][docs-new-issue]).

[docs-markdown]: http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/
[docs-new-issue]: https://github.com/symfony2admingenerator/AdmingeneratorGeneratorBundle/issues/new

### Basic formatting guide

While writing your issue please use Github Flavored Markdown to make it more readable. 

If you paste any code **wrap it in github's code block!** To do that start with 3 **```** characters, then name language you're useing, for example **yaml**:

> **```**yaml

> my.yaml_code:  is here

> **```**

will resuilt in:
```yaml
my.yaml_code:  is here
```
